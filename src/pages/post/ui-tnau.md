When a service-based company reached out to me to design and build a website for the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) Botanical Garden, I knew this was going to be a unique challenge. They had seen my work with Biocom, where I led the tech team, and were impressed enough to trust me with this project. The catch? I had just one week to deliver a fully functional and visually stunning website.

You can explore the final project on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tanishabisht/Website-TNAU-NextJS).

### The One-Week Sprint

Creating a website from scratch in just seven days required laser-focused planning and fast execution. But I wasn’t afraid of the tight timeline. We had already pulled off a similar feat with the Biocom Official website, which you can read about [here](/post/ui-biocom). That experience gave me the confidence to dive headfirst into this new challenge.

I spent the first 2-3 days immersed in the design, making sure it captured the lush, vibrant essence of the Botanical Garden. With some design guidance from [Sudhanshu Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viabreon/), our design team head, I crafted a user interface that felt fresh, modern, and engaging.

The goal was clear: the UI needed to reflect the natural beauty of the garden while still being fun and modern. Using Figma, I designed a visually striking, user-friendly layout that would resonate with visitors and keep them coming back. Below are the screenshots of my design.

With the design locked in, the next step was coding. Given the importance of SEO for attracting visitors, I chose Next.js as the tech stack, which struck the perfect balance between performance and optimization. Styling was all about control and precision, so I went with vanilla CSS to make sure every detail was just right.

In just one week, we turned a concept into a fully functional website that not only met but exceeded the client’s expectations. The TNAU Botanical Garden website is now live, a testament to what can be achieved with creativity, collaboration, and a clear vision.
