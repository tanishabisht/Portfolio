When evaluating a website, performance is a crucial aspect that encompasses several factors beyond just how quickly the site loads. Here’s a breakdown of the four key aspects of website performance—**page speed**, **responsiveness**, **stability**, and **resource usage**—along with their focus areas and key metrics.

## **Page Speed**

Page speed refers to how quickly the content of a web page loads and becomes viewable to users. It’s a critical factor in user satisfaction and can significantly impact search engine rankings.

#### **Key Metrics**
- **Page Load Time:** Measures the total time it takes for a page to load completely from the moment a user requests it until all content is fully visible.
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Indicates the time taken for the first byte of data to be received from the server. A lower TTFB means a faster response from the server.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** The time it takes for the first piece of content (text or image) to appear on the screen.


## **Responsiveness**

Responsiveness describes how well a website reacts to user interactions, such as clicks, taps, or scrolling. It reflects how smoothly and efficiently the site performs tasks in real time.

#### **Key Metrics**
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Measures the time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, meaning users can interact with all page elements without delays.
- **Input Latency:** Indicates the delay between a user action (e.g., clicking a button) and the website’s response to that action.
- **Scroll Performance:** Evaluates how smoothly the page scrolls, particularly during high-load operations or when large amounts of content are present.

## **Stability**

Stability refers to how well a website performs under various conditions, including high traffic or resource constraints. It measures the reliability and consistency of the site’s performance over time.

#### **Key Metrics**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures the time it takes for the largest content element (e.g., an image or block of text) to become visible on the screen.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift that occurs during the page load, which can affect user experience.
- **Error Rate:** Tracks the frequency of errors or issues encountered by users, such as broken links or failed requests.

## **Resource Usage**

Resource usage pertains to how efficiently a website uses system resources such as memory and CPU. It evaluates how well the site manages and optimizes these resources.

#### **Key Metrics**
- **Memory Usage:** Monitors the amount of memory used by the website during operation, including for scripts and media files.
- **CPU Usage:** Measures the amount of CPU resources consumed by the website, which can impact server performance and scalability.
- **Network Requests:** Tracks the number and size of network requests made by the website, as a high number can lead to increased load times and resource consumption.


Website performance isn't just about how fast a page loads. It also includes **page speed**, **responsiveness**, **stability**, and **resource usage**. Focusing on these factors ensures your site loads quickly and offers a smooth, reliable experience.
