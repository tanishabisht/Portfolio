**What is CMS?**

A Content Management System (CMS) is software that allows users to create, manage, and modify digital content without needing technical knowledge. It simplifies the process of managing website content and design.


**Traditional CMS**

Traditional CMS, such as WordPress or Joomla, combines both the frontend (what users see) and backend (where content is managed) into a single system. This means that the CMS controls both how content is created and how it is displayed to users. It’s an all-in-one solution that simplifies the management process but can be restrictive when it comes to customizing how and where content appears.


**Headless CMS: A Modern Approach**

A Headless CMS, on the other hand, separates the frontend from the backend. This means the CMS only handles the backend, managing content and data, while the frontend is built separately. The "head" in "headless" refers to the frontend, which is not included in this type of CMS. This separation allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as the frontend can be developed independently and adapted to various platforms—websites, mobile apps, or even digital displays—based on the project’s needs.


**Types of Headless CMS**

- **Git-Based Headless CMS:** This system uses Git to manage and store content. It combines version control with content management, allowing developers to handle content as code. Changes are made on the platform but are updated and saved in Git. Examples include Netlify CMS (now Decap CMS) and Forestry (now Tina.io).
- **API-First Headless CMS:** This system uses APIs to deliver content. Data is stored on the platform and can be accessed via APIs for use in various frontends. Changes made on the platform are directly reflected in the website. Examples include Contentful and Strapi.
