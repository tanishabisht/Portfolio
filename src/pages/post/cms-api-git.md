When building a website, one of the first decisions you’ll need to make is choosing the right Content Management System (CMS). Two popular options are API-based CMSs and Git-based CMSs. Let’s break down what each is and when you might want to use one over the other, using some real-world examples to keep things clear.

Imagine you’re building a personal blog where you write about your hobbies, like cooking or photography. If you want a simple setup where you write your content, save it, and have it instantly published, a **Git-based CMS** might be perfect. Here’s why: Git-based CMSs, like Netlify CMS or Decap CMS, store your content directly in your website’s code repository (the place where your website’s files live). Every time you update your content, it creates a new version of your website, much like saving different versions of a document. It’s simple, reliable, and works well for small websites where you want to have full control over every part of the site.

But let’s say you’re working on a more complex project, like an online store where products are constantly being added and updated by multiple team members. In this case, an **API-based CMS**, such as Contentful or Strapi, might be a better fit. An API-based CMS stores your content separately from your website’s code. Think of it like storing your content in a library, where the website can check out the latest content whenever it needs it. This setup allows for more flexibility: different parts of your website (or even different websites) can pull in the same content dynamically, and multiple people can work on different sections of the content without stepping on each other’s toes.

Now, let’s dive into what’s happening under the hood. With a **Git-based CMS**, whenever you make changes, it’s like you’re creating a new version of your entire website. This works great for static content, but it can become tricky when you have frequent updates or need to manage content across multiple websites.

On the other hand, with an **API-based CMS**, the content is stored separately in a database and accessed via an API (which is just a way for different software to talk to each other). This means your content and your website are loosely connected. Your website can request the latest content whenever it’s needed, without needing to rebuild the entire site. This is super useful for larger, dynamic websites where content changes often.

In summary, if you’re working on a simple website or blog, a Git-based CMS is probably the way to go. But if you’re dealing with a more complex project with dynamic content and multiple contributors, an API-based CMS will give you the flexibility you need. Understanding these differences will help you choose the right tool for your project, making your development process smoother and your website more efficient.
